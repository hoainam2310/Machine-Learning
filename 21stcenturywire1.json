For starters, the average age of alleged COVID fatalities in Italy was around 81 years of age in persons with multiple long-term chronic health conditions. Doctors have also pointed to a high uptake in Flu vaccinations during the previous winter which may have increased the risk of vulnerable contracting respiratory illnesses, a phenomenon which has been detailed in a number of scientific papers circulating among the medical community in Italy. Also, exactly as in New York and the UK, ICU hospital patients were recklessly pushed into to elderly care homes which appears to have exacerbated infections among the most vulnerable in residential care \u2013 directly driving up the \u2018COVID death\u2019 numbers in March and early April of 2020. In addition to this, thousands of elderly were also forced on to highly risky and unnecessary ventilator machines (forcing them into chemically induced comas) compounding their already weak state, further driving up Italy\u2019s sensational \u2018COVID death\u2019 count at the time. What\u2019s very clear from this testimony and analysis is that the outcomes in terms of fatalities from region to region, and hospital to hospital, vary greatly and seem to be down to the quality of care and methods of treatment being given to both outpatients and inpatients. Clearly, there were effective and often inexpensive drugs and therapeutic solutions available but which were not deployed for either economic or political reasons (in the case of and Ivermectin), neither made any practical sense. It seems that the atmosphere of hysteria and mass-panic generated by the media and politicians had effectively distorted what would normally be a considerate and professional response to a seasonal flu epidemic. Instead, it was an unnecessary and unmitigated disaster, not only for Italy but also for those countries which followed suit.", "is_fake": 1},

The shooting that took place in Paris is a tragedy of immense proportions, ruining the lives of many people, leaving a scar on French history and threatening the ideals of freedom of expression. This writer is not concerned with theories of a hoax where nobody was killed, nor the potential involvement of Reptilians, and would prefer to leave such ideas firmly behind; in favour of those which actually have supporting evidence. This piece is interested in presenting a theory of false flag terrorism, which has occurred numerous times throughout history, in parallel with evidence that can support such a theory and also show a motive for such actions. It is only through reasoned and well argued analysis that alternative theories can hope to gain ground in the mainstream consciousness. That being said, it is not possible to present any idea, official or otherwise, without some degree of subjectivity and speculation. However, the epistemological concern should be with the weight and relevance of the evidence invoked towards the case, not positivistic absolutism, and only you, the reader, can be the judge of that.The theory of false flag terrorism we will be exploring here is that of Dr. Webster Griffin Tarpley, which can be found in his book .

They had hoped to be able to take over the land and air space of Syria and ISIS controlled Iraq to build up forces so they could attack Iran. Now that is only possible by air attack and they know as we all know that despite the destruction they can wreak air bombardment alone does not win wars. So the US reneged on the Iran nuclear deal in order to have its pretext to impose crippling economic warfare on Iran, which has had the effect of devaluing its currency and making life difficult. Already some unrest has been provoked because of this and the actions of western agents in Iran. The Americans hope to cause enough unrest to bring down the Iranian government and impose their own puppets or direct western colonial rule but they do not understand either the will to resist nor the Persian culture and people.

Largely inhabited by Druze, Sweida was witness recently to a series of raids and suicide attacks by Islamic State which left over 200 dead. This caused some bitterness among the Druze who felt they had been left exposed by the Syrian Arab Army (SAA), but the feelings were mutual: the SAA are not enamoured of a Druze minority which has largely stayed aloof from Syria\u2019s conflict and refused to let its sons be conscripted or if conscripted be sent to other battlefields.Possibly mindful of the need to keep the Druze onside, the SAA, it appears, will now focus on countering IS in the Badiya before any major operations in Idlib. This will not be straightforward as IS has shifted to hit and run tactics and rarely now tries to hold territory. IS also benefits from the existence of the US-controlled Al Tanf enclave near where the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq meet. In June UK RAF aircraft bombed and killed pro-government forces which were chasing IS on the fringes of the 55 km radius enclave.

Many of those involved in these events refused to put down in writing their observations, because their testimony might prove that everything the previous generations had learned in official history books was actually false. But today we have reached a stage where we can no longer continue this approach, because today\u2019s battle is indeed a battle for existence, not only for the Palestinians, but for the people of the Arab Nation from the Ocean to the Gulf.The fact that the acceleration of Gulf normalisation with the Zionist enemy is a remarkable and serious fact, and its repercussions on the Arab-Israeli conflict should not be underestimated; on the contrary, we must prepare to face such ramifications. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf today own more than 80% of the Arab media, and their rulers, with their vast oil riches, are willing to spend generously to destroy the Arab confrontation countries, using terrorism to do so. Therefore, today the nation is facing a serious challenge, Saudi and Gulf money is being used to confuse minds of youth about the facts of the historical conflict with the Zionist enemy, and to distort the notions of Arab rights and interests. We should not continue with the approach which has been adopted over the past decades; we must, however, take the time and effort to study this phenomenon. We must not underestimate its importance and its negative effects, in order not to spread a false sense of reassurance and disregard about what is unfolding today. This is why the real Arab discourse must return to the root of the issue because the phenomenon of terrorism and its aftermath in all of our Arab countries from Iraq to Sudan, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Yemen are rooted in the Arab-Israeli conflict, the occupation of Palestine and the weakness of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. What are we going to do? We are the believers in our cause, our Arabism, the Arabism of Palestine and Jerusalem; how will we confront this new and dangerous tyranny of Saudi and Gulf capitulation to Israel?There is no doubt that the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on its land and its adherence to its rights constitutes the cornerstone of resisting this despicable colonial occupation, but this besieged people cannot be left with its very limited resources in the face of a Gulf-financed military machine supported by global and Gulf media. New paths to wage this struggle should benefit from the lessons learned by the resistance movements to colonial settlement, especially in Algeria and South Africa. In South Africa, the resistance, revolutionaries and liberals worked to form provincial movements all over the world worked to isolate the apartheid regime. Today I see that the Palestinian issue has reached this important crossroads. It is imperative that organisations, unions and Arab parties unite to put in place a working mechanism that will make the boycott of the Zionist enemy a permanent goal in every regional or international activity. In order to do this, it is necessary to form working teams with Palestinian leaders and Arab and international cadres, whose main objective is to raise awareness of the Palestinian issue and to shed light on the crimes of the occupation, and to compare between the Palestinians, the indigenous people of this land, with what happened to the native peoples of America and Australia who suffered from wars of genocide that led to the destruction of their culture, their way of life and their social and spiritual systems. Let us recognise that the difference between us and our enemies is that we have the right to this land. However, they were able to spread their propaganda across the world, using many diplomatic, media and financial means. While we, even though we have right on our side, have failed to employ the proper mechanisms in order to advance our cause.", "is_fake": 1},

His illegal arrest, by NATO forces in Belgrade, his illegal detention in Belgrade Central Prison, his illegal rendition to the former Gestapo prison at Scheveningen, near The Hague, and the show trial that followed, were all part of the drama played out for the world public, and it could only have one of two endings, the conviction, or the death, of President Milosevic.", "is_fake": 1},

{"date": "March 3, 2017", "title": "INTERVIEW: Patrick Henningsen on America, Iran and the Palestinian Question", "text": "The conference was very high level, with high delegates from all over the world. The issue of Palestine is of course an intense issue. People were very passionate about the issue. There are a number of reasons why I came to Iran to attend this conference. One of them is that I wanted to understand Iran\u2019s relationship with Palestine and why the issue is such a strong issue. Now I feel like I have a better understanding of that.I understand the issue of Palestine very well myself. But I have a limited experience with Iranian politics aside from the surface level. So my understanding or my feeling before I came was that Iran\u2019s support for the Palestine issue was more of a political connection, linked to support of Hezbollah and the Resistance. But what I have learned is more than this. It\u2019s not so much strategic interest. It\u2019s more of a justice, human rights and moral issue. I came to understand that; it was pretty clear. This is another dimension of understanding that I think is really important. So that was very valuable [to learn.]It\u2019s difficult to measure. I would say there are two ways you can look at it. Some might view Iran\u2019s support of Palestine as problematic; in that, you know people are very passionate about the issue, a very strong language is being used and it would seem to the Zionist regime and its allies that it would seem very aggressive rhetoric; they would translate it as a talk suggesting war. That\u2019s the potential negative perspective. On a positive perspective, if you look at how many Arab countries appear\u2014to me\u2014to be disinterested in the Palestinian issue. They may say they are with Palestine, but they\u2019re actions are not really there. The heartfelt support is no longer what it was before. And among countries that do support them, Lebanon has a hard situation because it\u2019s carrying the big burden of lots of refugees. So Lebanon is just surviving with the issue. Syria is under tremendous pressure right now with the war and that reduces its ability to be more of an advocate for Palestine right now. So the fact that Iran is so committed to supporting them, I think if Iran wasn\u2019t [supporting Palestine], there wouldn\u2019t be anybody who would. I know Turkey has made a lot of big gestures in support and so forth, but then also Turkey is doing joint military exercises with the Israeli regime. That\u2019s contradictory policy in a sense. I wouldn\u2019t question the sincerity of those in Turkey that support Palestine; I\u2019m sure they do it with all their heart. But in terms of the government maybe it doesn\u2019t look so good if they\u2019re allowing the Zionist state to use their airbases to do airstrikes on Syria\u2013 which they did for at least once or twice that we know of. So Iran is the main person standing up for Palestine. I\u2019m sure that means a lot to Palestinians to know that at least somebody is really strongly supporting them and without that they might think that they\u2019re alone and desperate and who knows where that would lead. Not that the situation is improving any; it\u2019s getting worse in Palestine\u2014clearly. But at least some support is better than no support. So it\u2019s hard to measure if it\u2019s effective or no. Maybe it is not positive in the plus sense, but I certainly do not think it\u2019s a negative thing although the proposed Jewish state\u00a0and the United States would say it\u2019s a negative thing to have Iran support the Palestine issue; which I think is unfair because the U.S. government don\u2019t acknowledge that the Palestinians are suffering. They don\u2019t have any compassion at all. For them it\u2019s an easier political path to not support Palestine and to give full support to Israeli regime.

These \u2018acquis sociaux\u2019 or social gains are now being brutally rolled back by a powerful oligarchy bent on driving down the price of labour and increasing the profits of capitalists.One of the reasons why French society made such dramatic economic and social progress after the Second World War was due to the strong presence of the French Communist Party (PCF). The PCF played a key role in resisting and overthrowing the Nazi occupation. By the end of the war they were the largest and most powerful party in France. Communists had a significant influence over the policies of the National Council of the Resistance and it was their alliance with the Gaullists that created a strong, industrial state-directed economy; free education, universal health care and modest improvements in the standard of living. However, French communists had never developed a revolutionary strategy capable of seizing power and imposing a dictatorship of the proletariat.The Communist International had never approved of the nomination of Maurice Thorez as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1930, as they had correctly judged that he had not grasped the Marxist conception of the state. The deaths of great French communists Henri Barbusse and Fernand Grenier before and during the war also dealt a blow to the prospects of effective revolutionary leadership. Thorez\u2019s speeches and writing reveal that he was closer to Rousseau than Marx; the French communist was more of a petty-bourgeois humanist than a revolutionary Leninist. President De Gaulle is said to have remarked that there would be no communist revolution in France while Thorez was head of the PCF \u2013 he was right.", "is_fake": 1},

For some countries like the UK, economists argue this depression lasted until at least 1895. The crisis started in April 1873 with the collapse, or near collapse of several major stock markets. The same year, in September, the New York stock exchange closed for 10 straight days to stem panic.The depression was most severe in Europe and the United States, for several converging reasons including previous fast economic growth on the back of the always intensifying Industrial Revolution, early market saturation, declining innovation, raw material shortages, international warfare and reparations payments (especially by France to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War), deflation, and rising competition. Other reasons and results of the crisis included the massive growth of land and home prices and the easy profit made by land owners and landlords, denounced by American journalist Henry George, but his popular writings did not include Thorstein Veblen\u2019s later economic analysis of the Long Depression. Veblen called the long depression the \u201ctriumph of capital rent\u201d. One visible result of this was \u201cthe leisure class\u201d, the title of Veblen\u2019s best-known book.Interest rates tended to stay high or very high (especially in UK), during a period of general deflation.

Would Israelis be happy to learn that 1500 of their rockets had had such limited effect? Would any western army accept such a result at such a cost? The answer is a categorical NO. But the Palestinians are ecstatic, why, because they know they have won the battle and are now set to win the war. They won the battle, not because they killed six Israelis \u2013 actually they would have won it without hitting one single Israeli. They won it because they managed to deliver a message to Israel, world Jewry and the whole world.For many years I have argued that the Palestinian war of the rockets should be seen as sending a message: Israelis! You are on stolen land! You took our houses, villages, cities, fields and orchards. You pushed us into the desert. You surrounded us with barbed wire. You starve us and you kill us simply to suit your political ambitions. So this rocket is a message to you all. Think about us and then look at yourself in the mirror. ", "is_fake": 1},

The good hygiene and virus avoidance advice noted above is helpful, although it is probably a bit overblown when discussing how important a mask is in preventing virus transmission, especially outdoors. It seems ludicrous to mandate mask wearing at all times, indoors and outdoors, although this is being given consideration by some governmental (and medical) authorities at the time of this writing. However, this advice only scratches the surface with regard to the numerous options available to avoid contracting this infection, or to even cure it. There is no point in suffering from misguided advice when COVID-19 can be prevented or reliably cured in short order. As will be clearly explained in this article, nobody needs to die from COVID-19, or even to suffer needlessly (as many virus victims have remained quite ill for months before finally recovering).While still unknown to most practitioners of traditional, or \u201cmodern\u201d medicine, acute viral syndromes, COVID-19 included, can all be easily prevented most of the time. And when such viruses do get a foothold in the body, they are still easily eradicated if the patient is not too close to death before receiving any of a large number of treatments established to be effective. Many doctors get attacked for promoting treatments as cures for afflictions that are traditionally considered to be incurable. Certainly, it is true that some treatments promoted as being reliable cures are either fraudulent or of only nominal benefit. However, failing to assert the validity of a true cure for a medical condition is just as detrimental to the health of an ailing patient as it is promoting a false cure. Many doctors know of highly beneficial treatments that cure or vastly improve medical conditions that are little affected by traditional therapies. Yet, fear of license revocation for telling the truth about inexpensive and natural therapies that cannot be protected by patents keeps most health care practitioners from promoting those beneficial therapies.

The present response to the coronavirus has led to panic that has traded rational responses for irrational reactions.Acting upon incomplete and probably inaccurate information, our government has embarked upon a spending spree and encroachment on the liberties of Americans of massive proportions. Logic would dictate that from now on, every flu season, our economy must shut down and the government print, thereby inflating, more money and spend it on non-productive transfers. The sphere of liberty shrinks as the size of government grows. The current response to \u201cChinese flu\u201d has led to policies unheard of in American history with yet unknown consequences. When people believe that government can cure anything (pun intended), they are exhibiting symptoms of a disease far more serious than COVID-19.", "is_fake": 1},

The immediacy of\u00a0the order caught many people off\u00a0guard, and there was confusion about\u00a0whether it would apply to\u00a0permanent residents (green card-holders), already-vetted refugees, and individuals in\u00a0transit. Almost immediately after\u00a0the announcement was made last Friday, thousands of\u00a0people across\u00a0the US flocked to\u00a0their local airports to\u00a0protest the measure. In doing so, they defied what are ordinarily strict security measures, which during\u00a0regular times would prohibit such large-scale gatherings at\u00a0locations considered essential to\u00a0the nation\u2019s infrastructure.The protesters claimed that Trump had \u201cbanned Muslims\u201d from\u00a0entering the US, and the hashtag #MuslimBan instantly started trending on\u00a0Twitter. In defense of\u00a0the motion, Trump and his surrogates said that most majority-Muslim countries were untouched by\u00a0the temporary border restrictions, pointing out\u00a0that Indonesia \u2013 the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country \u2013 isn\u2019t on\u00a0the list, for\u00a0example. Moreover, in\u00a0a cynical retort to\u00a0the critics, they reminded the public that Obama had earlier suspended the US refugee program for\u00a0Iraqi nationals for\u00a0half a year back in\u00a02011, though no such protests erupted at\u00a0that time. Nevertheless, it\u2019s hard for\u00a0the Trump Administration to\u00a0shake the social media stigma that this is a \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d, no matter how convincingly they may argue that it amounts to\u00a0nothing more than\u00a0a brief review period for\u00a0high-risk countries prior to\u00a0the implementation of\u00a0what\u2019s being called \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d This is because the mainstream US media is very sympathetic to\u00a0what Trump and his spokespeople have termed the \u201cpolitical opposition,\u201d namely, the Democratic Party.", "is_fake": 1},

Estimates as to the rise in real income for salaried workers over the past 40 years range from 20% to 28 %. In that period, real GDP has risen by 110% \u2013 it has more than doubled.\u00a0 To put it somewhat differently, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \u00a0the top earning 1 percent of households gained about 8X more than those in the 60 percentile after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007; 10X those in lower percentiles. \u00a0In short, the overwhelming fraction of all the wealth created over two generations has gone to those at the very top of the income pyramid.\u00a0 That pattern has been markedly accelerated since the financial crisis hit in 2008.
